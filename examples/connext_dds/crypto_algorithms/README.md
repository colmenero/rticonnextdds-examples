# Example Code: Crypto algorithms

## Concept

This example is a secure Hello World application between a publisher and a
subscriber. The publisher and subscriber DomainParticipants will use a different
configuration depending on the scenario passed as the third command-line
argument. These scenarios show some of the possible combinations for the digital
signature, key establishment, and symmetric cipher algorithms. The example also
shows how the `<allowed_security_algorithms>` tag of the Governance Document
affects DomainParticipant matching.


## Example description

TODO SEC-1750: List the different scenarios.
